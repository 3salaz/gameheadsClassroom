### Twine Website
Goal:
**We want to make sure you understand how to use your command line, as well as git & github.For this we will use your twine export, it should look similar to`[your-twine-name].html`. We will use the command line to move around and create a folder for your twine html file, we'll use git commands to initialize, add and push your folder repository to github. If done correctly we'll have your twine website on github after adjusting the settings**

> - Using the command line and git. Place your twine index file into a project folder
> - Name the folder twine-website
> - Use git init to create a git repository in this folder.
> - Go to github.com and create a repository, this will house the location you want to send your files from your machine.
> - Use the command line to git add and commit your file.
> - Head back to github and copy the code provided after you create your repository.
> - Paste these commands into the command line and it should send your twine file to your github file.
> - Go to your **settings**, and under **pages** set your branch to main. After a couple seconds you should see something like `Your site is live at https://3salaz.github.io/twine-website/`
> - Done!
